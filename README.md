<h1>PetStore Supplies Computer Base System</h1>
Welcome to the PetStore Supplies Computer Base System repository! This project is a C++ program that is inspired by online stores like Shopee. It allows a pet store to manage their inventory and sales of supplies in a similar way to how an online store operates. Customers can browse the store's inventory and add items to their virtual cart. They can then proceed to checkout and make a payment through the system. The system also allows the store to process customer orders and keep track of their purchases. It calculates the total cost of an order and updates the inventory accordingly. The system is user-friendly and easy to use, making it a valuable asset to the pet store's operations. It allows the store to offer a convenient shopping experience for their customers, similar to what they would find on an online store.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
In this repository, you will find the source code for the project as well as documentation on how to use and set up the system. To get started, you will need a C++ compiler. Once you have the compiler, you can run the program.

<h2>Usage</h2>
To use the PetStore Supplies Computer Base System, follow the prompts in the program. You can add items to the inventory, process customer orders, and view the store's sales data.
